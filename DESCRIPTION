Description: Provides robust nonparametric prediction intervals for regression models.
    This package implements several methods, including k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)
    and Kernel Density Estimation (KDE), to estimate the conditional
    distribution of the response. A key feature is the inclusion of robust
    fallback mechanisms that switch to a global linear model when local
    estimates are deemed unreliable, ensuring interval stability. The package
    also provides tools for evaluation and visualization.
