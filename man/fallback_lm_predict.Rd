\title{Predict with Fallback Linear Model}
\usage{
fallback_lm_predict(lm_model, X_new_row, alpha)
}
\arguments{
\item{lm_model}{A fitted linear model object (e.g., from `lm()`).}

\item{X_new_row}{A data frame or matrix containing a single new observation
for which to predict.}

\item{alpha}{A numeric value between 0 and 1, representing the significance
level for the prediction interval.}
}
\value{
A list containing two components:
  \item{L}{The lower prediction bound.}
  \item{U}{The upper prediction bound.}
}
\description{
This internal utility function uses a pre-fitted linear model to generate
prediction intervals. It serves as a fallback mechanism when nonparametric
local estimates are deemed unreliable.
