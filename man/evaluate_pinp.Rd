\title{Evaluate Prediction Interval Performance}
\usage{
evaluate_pinp(y_true, L, U, alpha = 0.1)
}
\arguments{
\item{y_true}{A numeric vector of true response values.}

\item{L}{A numeric vector of lower prediction interval bounds.}

\item{U}{A numeric vector of upper prediction interval bounds.}

\item{alpha}{A numeric value representing the significance level at which the
intervals were constructed. This is used for calculating the Winkler score.}
}
\value{
A data frame with one row and four columns:
  \item{Coverage}{The proportion of true values that fall within their
    corresponding prediction interval.}
  \item{Avg_Width}{The average width of the prediction intervals.}
  \item{Winkler_Score}{The mean Winkler score, which penalizes both for
    wide intervals and for lack of coverage.}
  \item{Target_Alpha}{The significance level `alpha` provided.}
}
\description{
Calculates key performance metrics for a set of prediction intervals,
including coverage, average width, and the Winkler score.

\examples{
y_true <- 1:10
L <- y_true - 2
U <- y_true + 2
evaluate_pinp(y_true, L, U, alpha = 0.1)

# Example with some out-of-bounds points
y_true <- c(5, 6, 7, 8, 15)
L <- c(4, 5, 6, 7, 8)
U <- c(6, 7, 8, 9, 10)
evaluate_pinp(y_true, L, U, alpha = 0.2)
}
