\title{Calculate Effective Sample Size}
\usage{
effective_n(weights)
}
\arguments{
\item{weights}{A numeric vector of weights.}
}
\value{
A numeric value representing the effective sample size. Returns 0
  if the sum of squared weights is zero to avoid division by zero.
}
\description{
This internal utility function calculates the effective sample size from a
vector of weights using Kish's approximation. It is used as a diagnostic
to assess the reliability of a local estimate.
